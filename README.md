# DynamicMovingButtonsAndroid

This is an app created by me for Psychology professor, for his survey on Human Behavior.

With this code you can:

1. Upload an image from the library or take a picture from the application
2. With "Add" button you can add upto 10 buttons and drag them onto the image. 
3. With "Remove" button you can remove the previosly added buttons in reverse chronological order.
4. After adding the buttons you can drag them and place them on the image.
5. When you click the dragged buttons, depending on the number of times you click the button, the count caries in the respective box.
6. After the desired number of clicks, you can save the image with the buttons in a specific position with a name, and perform a new survey.
7. You can select from the previosly saved projects(max 10) and start from where you left off. 

Hope this helps for any of your work.
